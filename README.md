<p>Cali Caf√© is a coffee shop local to Riverview, FL. The business owner had great concern for his online image but had yet to find the time to produce a proper website. Google had automatically deployed a site when he had made a Google Business account but this site was extraordinarily unnactractive and glitchy. His primary concerns were site visibility, flow, and aesthetic. I offered to take on the project myself. I believe it was my reassurance that "I could complete this project without eating into your time" that sold him on the idea.</p>
